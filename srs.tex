The main concept of "IICT WEBSITE" is to devitalized PGD, MIT courses, their students and teachers data maintenance. 

\section{Intended Audience and Reading Suggestions}
This SRS is for developers, project managers, users and testers. Further the discussion will provide all the internal, external, functional and also non-functional informations about "IICT WEBSITE".

\section{Project Scope}
"IICT WEBSITE" creates a space for Director, Teachers, Students and Office Staffs for maintaining particular programs like - PGD, MIT. 
\newline
After getting admitted to a programs a student has been given a registration number, by using which he/she can inter from-fill-up page.

\end{figure}
\newline
Figure 1.1 (Entire work-flow) is the overview of the project. Connection of all the entities are dependable to each others.  This gives the simple idea about the functional activities of the project. 
\newline
Student cycle, In the Figure 1.1 "Student" takes "Courses" ; "Courses" is guided by "Teachers"; "Teachers" creates "Results". 
\newline
Teacher cycle, In the Figure 1.1 "Director" assign "Teachers"; "Teachers" for particular "Courses"; "Director" publish "Results".
\newline
So, every entity is vary much interactive with each other.

\section{Product Functions}
"IICT WEBSITE" store all the results of the students of program PGD, MIT. Also others programs can be included if necessary.
\begin{figure}[h!]

    \caption{Data Flow Diagram}
    \label{fig:Data Flow Diagram}
\end{figure}
Before using the main function of the software result process, users have to be registered. 
\newline
All users have - login\_parameter, user\_name, first\_name, last\_name, user\_id, role, post, email, phone\_number, present\_address, parmanent\_address, blood\_group, password\_hash and timeStamp.
\newline
Students have some extra informations after complete his/her registration , such as - user\_id(foreign key), registration\_id, year, semester, course\_array and drop\_course\_array. These are the information that contains his/her result of his taken courses and program.
\newline
Each programs has some data - program\_name, program\_id, course\_id, nunmber\_of\_semester, total\_credit and course\_length. There will be onew or many course\_id in each programs.
\newline
Courses table contains - course\_name, course\_id, course\_code, credit, semester and teacher\_id.
\newline
Every course has its own Credit Values. Those have been 2 types - lab, theory.
\newline
Result is the main feature of all. It contains the values of all the exams of a particular student. It has data field - student\_id, course\_id, term\_test, attendance, marks(A), marks(B), teacher\_id(A), teacher\_id(B), entry\_date(A), entry\_date(B), publish\_date, semester	and result\_state.

\section{Operating Environment}
The website will be operate in any Operating Environment - Mac, Windows, Linux etc. 

\section{Design}
Student activities have 3 steps -
\begin{itemize}
    \item From Fill Up Process
